## About The Project

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that is played by two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their symbol (either "X" or "O") in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no one has won, the game is tied.
